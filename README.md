# Stock-Alert-App

*UPDATE :-*
- Google has stopped support for less secure apps, hence the smtplib won't work for gmail addresses. Try using outlook instead of gmail.


*NOTE :-*
- The Stock List can contain only 5 stocks at a time since the api provides only 5 free calls at a time. If you plan to add more stocks to the list, try upgrading to API services to a paid one.
